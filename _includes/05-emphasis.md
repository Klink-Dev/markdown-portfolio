This is a test of different emphasis that can be used in md

**For Bold, use double asterisks or double underscores**
__Put them at the beginning and end of the text you want to emphasize__

*Italic text only uses one asterisk or underscore*
_but you must still put them at the beginning and the end_

*since unordered lists also use asterisks, note that they also have a __space__ between the asterisk and the text*
